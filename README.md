# IOT-Enabled-Plant-Care
This project is a smart plant monitoring and care system using IoT. It automates the irrigation and climate control process based on real-time sensor data, helping ensure healthy plant growth with minimal human intervention.
🔧 Features
- Soil Moisture Monitoring using a soil moisture sensor
- Temperature & Humidity Monitoring using DHT11 sensor
- Automated Watering with a water pump when soil is dry
- Climate Regulation using a fan based on ambient temperature
- Live Monitoring of data on a cloud dashboard 
- Microcontroller Used: ESP8266

🛠️ Components Used
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- Water Pump
- Relay Module
- Fan
- Microcontroller (ESP8266)

• Cloud Platform (ThingSpeak,Remotexy)

📊 Data Visualization
The system pushes real-time sensor data to the cloud for monitoring. You can track:
- Soil moisture levels
- Temperature and humidity
- System activity (watering/fan status)
